OpenBACH
========

OpenBACH is a user-friendly and efficient benchmark to configure, supervise and
control your network under test (e.g. terrestrial networks, satellite networks,
WAN, LAN, etc.). It provides an efficient modular structure to facilitate the
additions of new software tools, monitoring parameters, tasks, etc. The
benchmark is able to be integrated in different types of equipments, servers,
clients, hardware and software with minimal adaptation effort.

This platform has been promoted by CNES (French Space Center) as a reference
open-source software tool within its research and development studies and
activities in the domain of satellite network communications systems. OpenBACH
has been developped in order to be complementary to OpenSAND, the satellite
network emulator.

The documentation is scattered in this repository through README files at
appropriate places, a table of content is available below.

Design Principles
=================

![functions design](documents/basic_func_design.png)

  * A **user** can pilot OpenBACH through a web or command-line **Auditorium** interface
  * This interface manipulates metrology **scenarios** on OpenBACH **Controller**
  * The controller orchestrate **jobs** on distributed **Agents**
  * Agents can send stats and logs to OpenBACH global **collector**
  * The web auditorium provides ways to visualize these stats and logs (using Grafana and Kibana)
  * The user can code new jobs, install them on the agents and launch them with the controller

The full design is available in details in [the design document](documents/design/design_openbach.adoc).
