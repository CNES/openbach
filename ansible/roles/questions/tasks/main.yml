        This installation playbook will override the NTP configuration on each agents
        so they use the controller as an NTP source.

        You have the ability to select the NTP source server that will be used on the
        controller by entering its network address or keep the existing configuration
        by pressing enter or typing 'keep'. If you wish to keep the existing
        configuration on all agents instead, you can cancel this playbook (^C) and
        restart it using the '--skip-tags configure_ntp_server' flag.
