module: jobs_metadata

short_description: This module fetches metadata of jobs in the given folders

version_added: "2.4"

description:
    - "This module gathers the names and paths of jobs found in the given folders. It works by recursively searching for .yml files in a files subfolder and checking that the matching install_xxx.yml and uninstall_xxx.yml exist in the parent folder."

options:
    folders:
        description:
            - A list of the folders to search jobs into
        required: true
    substitute:
        description:
            - A path to substitute the root folder name by
        required: false
    limit:
        description:
            - Limit the collected informations to the ones of the jobs in this list
