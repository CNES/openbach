By default the job calculates the average.
To take into consideration the time zones of the different agents, it is possible to specify the start time of the day, evening and night.
      ==> "-sj" ,"-se" and "-sn"
The "-n" parameter take list of OpenBACH name of the agents to fetch data from and the "-j" parameter the OpenBACH name of the job

Several statistics can be retrieved from the same job or from several jobs. The job will create a xlsx file per statistic, so a list of agents, begin_date,end_date need to be specified for each statistic.
