=== Job Description ===

This job executes iperf3 tool to perform network capacity measurements.

Important Note : if the parameter 'transmitted_size' is used, its value has to be EQUAL OR HIGHER than 1 MByte. This limitation is due to the issues presented by iperf3 to send small sized files.

=== Examples ===

== Example 1 ==

Generate 2 UDP parallel flows from Agent "client" to Agent "server" (IP address ''192.168.1.4'') during 30 seconds. Each flow must send 5Mb/s of traffic. The statistics must be collected every 2 seconds.

In the web interface, set the following parameters:

  * For Agent "server":
    * **metrics_interval** = 2
    * **num_flows** = 2
    * **mode** = server
    * **exit** = True
  * For Agent "client":
    * **metrics_interval** = 2
    * **duration** = 60
    * **num_flows** = 2
    * **mode** = client
    * **server_ip** = 192.168.1.4
    * **duration** = 60
    * **protocol** = udp
    * **bandwidth** = 10M

Or launch the job manually from the Agent as follows:

From server Agent:
<code>
JOB_NAME=iperf3 sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/iperf3/iperf3.py -n 2 server -1
</code>

From client Agent:
<code>
JOB_NAME=iperf3 sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/iperf3/iperf3.py -n 2 client 192.168.1.4 -t 60.0 udp -b 10M
</code>

== Example 2 ==

Generate 1 TCP flow from Agent "client" to Agent "server" (IP address ''192.168.1.4'') which sends a total amount of 10 Gbytes of data. The statistics must be collected every 1 seconds.

In the web interface, set the following parameters:

  * For Agent "server":
    * **metrics_interval** = 1
    * **mode** = server
    * **exit** = True
  * For Agent "client":
    * **metrics_interval** = 1
    * **transmitted_size** = 10G
    * **mode** = client
    * **server_ip** = 192.168.1.4
    * **protocol** = tcp

Or launch the job manually from the Agent as follows:

From server Agent:
<code>
JOB_NAME=iperf3 sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/iperf3/iperf3.py -n 1 server -1
</code>

From client Agent:
<code>
JOB_NAME=iperf3 sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/iperf3/iperf3.py -n 1 client 192.168.1.4 -s 10G tcp
</code>
