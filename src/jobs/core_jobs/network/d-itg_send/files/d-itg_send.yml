      This Job principaly launches the executable of D-ITG
      that sends data towards a target. The flow is unilateral.
      It is possible to launch multiple instances of the job at the same time.

          Way to compute the time: One Way Delay (owdm) or Round Trip Time (rttm).
          Default: owdm
          Careful, if "rttm" is chosen, a bidirectional traffic will be generated for the sender to compute the RTT.
          However, if anykind of synchronization doesn't exist between the equipments, rttm is advised.
      choices:
          - owdm
          - rttm
