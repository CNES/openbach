=== Job description ===

This job applies or clears configuration on the network interface. It uses ip link, netem and qdisc.

=== Examples ===

== Example 1 ==

Apply on the interface ens4 of the agent Agent-1 a delay (200ms), a maximum bandwith (20Mb/s) and a buffer size of 50000 packets, only on egress.

In the web interface, set the following parameters:
  * **interface_name** = ens4
  * **operation** = apply
  * **mode** = egress
  * **bandwidth** = 20M
  * **delay** = 200
  * **buffer_size** = 50000

Or launch the job manually from the Agent as follows:
<code>
JOB_NAME=tc_configure_link sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/tc_configure_link/tc_configure_link.py ens4 apply -m egress -b 20M -d 200 --buffer_size 50000
</code>

== Example 2 ==

Clear all change apply on ingress on the interface ens3 and ens4.

In the web interface, set the following parameters:
  * **interface_name** = ens3,ens4
  * **operation** = clear
  * **mode** = ingress

Or launch the job manually from the Agent as follows:
<code>
JOB_NAME=tc_configure_link sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/tc_configure_link/tc_configure_link.py ens3,ens4 clear -m ingress
</code>

=== Additional information ===

<note important>
This job may encounter performance issues when it operates on the machine that is generating traffic.
It is recommended to launch this job on a separate machine.
</note>

<note important>
There may be issues when the configurations are applied on the ingress. As an example, problems were encountered when the //buffer_size// of the ingress is large. Whenever it is possible, it is recommended to apply the configuration on the network interface on the egress.
