          <p>Thank you for your participation in the OpenBACH Open Source <b>Community</b> (“OpenBACH
          Community”), an open source community originally created and sponsored by the “Centre National
          des Etudes Spatiales” (“CNES”) (the “<b>CNES</b>” being designed in this agreement as the
          “Steering Committee”).</p>
          <p>“OpenBACH” is the name of the software engineering and research platform, including its
          documentation, the aim of which is to provide a benchmark of tests supervision/monitoring. It has
          been promoted afterwards by CNES as a reference open-source software tool for use within its
          research and development studies and activities in the domain of satellite communication systems
          and networks.</p>
          <p>By distributing and making available the source codes of OpenBACH components “as is” under the
          terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License version 3 (“<b>GPL</b>”), the intention of
          the CNES is to facilitate its use and encourage any Contributions, improvement and perpetuation
          of OpenBACH for the benefit of the whole OpenBACH Community, the objective of the CNES being also
          to optimize and rationalize more the research and development in this domain, avoid duplication of
          efforts and therefore facilitate programs of new satellite solutions. In order to better exchange,
          share and learn information about OpenBACH, contributors will have also the possibility to
          participate to meetings organized and announced by the Steering Committee of OpenBACH Community
          on the web site <a href="http://www.openbach.org" title="OpenBACH website">
          <b>http://www.openbach.org</b></a>.</p>

            <li><b>GOVERNANCE OF OpenBACH COMMUNITY</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              The OpenBACH Community is governed and managed by a Steering Committee in charge of all
              technical and administrative decisions concerning OpenBACH.
              <br>
              <br>
              CNES as founders of OpenBACH Community and major contributors, are the first Members of such
              Steering Committee. Depending on their Contributions into OpenBACH, the Steering Committee may
              decide, by unanimous decision, to invite other important contributors to join the Steering
              Committee as new Members.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES / LIABILITY</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has
              rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
              that you have received permission to make Contribution on behalf of that employer.
              <br>
              <br>
              You represent that each of your Contributions is your original creation. If not, complete
              details of any third party license or other restriction must be included in the
              <a rel="section" href="#rights">required field</a> if any in your Contributions submissions
              (including but not limited to related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware
              and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.
              <br>
              <br>
              Contributors acknowledge that the scientific and technical state-of-the art when OpenBACH
              Initial Work was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor
              the presence of possible defects to be detected. As far as permitted  by applicable law,
              Members of the Steering Committee  and Contributors will provide OpenBACH Initial Work and any
              Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
              or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
              NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

            <li><b>LIABILITY OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE’S MEMBERS</b>

              due to the use or performance of OpenBACH. More generally, members of the Steering Committee
              shall have no liability for any incidental, consequential, special, exemplary and punitive
              damages, whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or

              profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders, any disturbance to business activities) or
              any or all legal proceedings instituted against Contributors by a third party shall constitute
              consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to any compensation from Members of the
              Steering Committee.
              <br>
              <br>
